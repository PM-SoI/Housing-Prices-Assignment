## General Information:
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has  decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to  purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a  higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set  from the sale of houses in Australia.

## Problem Statement: 
- You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

  Objectives :

  a. To prepare a regression model using regularization in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

  b. To identify which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

  c. To explain How well those variables describe the price of a house.

## Project Methodology: 
1. Data Understanding: Reading & Understanding the dataset
2. Data Exploration or Visualizing the data: Uni/Bi/Multi-variate Analysis, Numeric & Categorical visualization etc.
3. Data Preparation: Scaling, Data Splitting (Train and Test)
6. Feature Engineering: Feature Selection (RFE and Manual) using VIF and p-values.
7. Model Building: Regression Model
6. Residual Analysis of the Model output.
7. Model Evaluation:  Residual Analysis of the Model output, Model interpretability and accuracy using metrics like R2 score, RMSE, MSE etc.
8. Application of Regularization Methods : RIDGE and LASSO

## Conclusions
- A Linear Regression model was developed and Housing Sale Prices are predicted using Model.
- Regularized Regression model implementations were made for RIDGE and LASSO  for reduced Model Complexity and making predictions for the Housing Sale Prices.

## Technologies Used
- Python IDE was used for coding and implementing the ML models.
